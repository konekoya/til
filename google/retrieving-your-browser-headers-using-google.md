# Retrieving Your Browser Headers Using Google

If you're working on web scraping or need to obtain your browser headers, you may be familiar with tools like [WhatIsMyBrowser.com](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-http-headers-is-my-browser-sending). However, you can also quickly retrieve your browser headers using Google.

To do so, simply go to [google.com](https://www.google.com/) and type "my user agent" into the search box (or just type in your browser address bar if Google is your default search engine of the browser). Google will then display your browser headers in the search results, as shown in the screenshot below:

This is a convenient alternative for those who only need to quickly retrieve their browser headers.
