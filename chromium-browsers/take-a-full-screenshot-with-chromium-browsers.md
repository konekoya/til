# Take a Full Screenshot with Chromium Browsers

Capturing screenshots of browser content that extends beyond the visible viewport can be tricky. While there are software options like Faststone (Windows only app) that can do the job, Chromium browsers like Google Chrome have a built-in feature that makes the process a lot easier.

Here's how you can take a full screenshot using Chrome:

1. Go to the web page that you want to capture
2. Open DevTools with: `cmd` + `opt` + `I`
3. Open the Run Command prompt: `cmd` + `shift` + `P`
4. Type "screenshot" in the prompt and select **Capture full size screenshot** from the list of suggestions and hit return key
5. Wait a few seconds for the screenshot to finish processing and then save the file

> Note that this feature is likely available in all Chromium-based browsers.
